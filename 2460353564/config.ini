extended_description="Sakuya plays differently from most platform fighter characters thanks to her mobile knife throwing abilities. Jab, Ftilt, Utilt, dash attack, Nair, Fair, Bair, Dair, and Uair all throw knives and can be done without stopping her momentum, even when moving on the ground. This allows her to approach on the ground while throwing knives, or to retreat backwards while throwing knives forward at her opponents."
