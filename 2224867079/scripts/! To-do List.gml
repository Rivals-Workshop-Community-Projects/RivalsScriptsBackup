Here's a list of suggestions i got from the community
if i implement the suggestion i'll remove it from this list

///////GAMEPLAY//////
- Both uspecials lack readable startup.
- Red uspecial would feel much better if it were angleable.
- Dtilt has no readable startup / anticipation and lacks overshoot. Motion feels linear, I suggest easing.

////////SPRITES//////
- Dair: lacks overshoot. Motion feels linear, I suggest easing.
- Shrinks during jump/pratfall?
- Blue dstrong's vfx don't dissipate well.
- Base sprite seems kind of odd, pose seems a little awkward imo
- Lack of shading on the legs, arms, or hair? Their being black makes them especially hard to see on darker stages
- Hit particles looks kind of weird, I would suggest using RoA's native hit particle system.
- Fstrong both modes: body grows
- Red dstrong's posing is really bad, lacks proper anticipation and overshoot
