Here's a list of suggestions i got from the community
if i implement the suggestion i'll remove it from this list

///////GAMEPLAY//////
- Both uspecials lack readable startup.
- Red uspecial would feel much better if it were angleable.
- Dtilt has no readable startup / anticipation and lacks overshoot. Motion feels linear, I suggest easing.

////////SPRITES//////
- Dair: lacks overshoot. Motion feels linear, I suggest easing.
- Shrinks during jump/pratfall?
- Blue dstrong's vfx don't dissipate well.
- Base sprite seems kind of odd, pose seems a little awkward imo
- Lack of shading on the legs, arms, or hair? Their being black makes them especially hard to see on darker stages
- Hit particles looks kind of weird, I would suggest using RoA's native hit particle system.
- Fstrong both modes: body grows
- Red dstrong's posing is really bad, lacks proper anticipation and overshoot

-Utilt goes too high
-Utilt has too much endlag
-Dair has too much landing lag
8
-Pratfall time is too low, set it to 10
-his max air speed should also probably be 6, he has the same as ori rn

Red mode initial dash speed should be 9
Red mode air max speed should be 4 (this sounds really low but its the average)

Blue mode dash speed should be 6.25
Blue mode initial dash speed should be 6.25
Blue mode air max speed should be 6
Blue mode double jump speed should be 11

Both modes should have .04 air friction
ik zetter fireball has 45f of cooldown if you want to try that (nspecial)
blue fsmash doing 17
wind on hurtbox
the entire move is a hurtbox actually, you could probably give it a bit of disjoint at the end

add whifflag

this is very very strong kb wise for a hitbox you can use in the air

you could probably try 9 bkb here (red uspecial)

also sorry for not noticing this but maybe you could have the first hit drag into the second hit?
like zetter dsmash
