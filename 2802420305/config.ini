info1="The original Tetris theme song is almost as iconic as the game itself. So much so, that itâ€™s easy to forget where the music originated from, and just how much it has evolved over the years. First and foremost, the true name of the Tetris theme is Korobeiniki (the Russian word for peddlers), and it was initially created as a poem by Nikolay Nekrasov in 1861."
info2="The Tetris effect (also known as Tetris syndrome) occurs when people devote so much time and attention to an activity that it begins to pattern their thoughts, mental images, and dreams."
