description="Sonic joins the world of Rivals! This time, he's got the power of Wisps on his side - after use, they leave behind Wisp Capsules, which you can hit into enemies OR use to chain Specials together! He can also use techniques like the Spin Dash, Drop Dash, and all three Elemental Shields. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods."
