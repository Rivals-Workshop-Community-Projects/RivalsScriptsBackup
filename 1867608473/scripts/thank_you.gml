If you're poking through the files and stumbled upon this, hopefully this
is a nice surprise. I wanted to write something as a way to give thanks to
all of the important people I've met in my time here in the Rivals of Aether
Steam Workshop community.

If you're looking for some kind of secret in here, that points to some hidden
character that is meant to exist, I'm afraid you won't find it here. It's been
lost to the shadows. But, if you must be rewarded, Kris DE's update has actually
been publicly playable for years.

The way you could've accessed it was by looking at the numbers found in Eirlys'
Genesis Skin's taunt upon "reloading" the game. Each one, combined, would make
the URL ID for the Kris DE Beta. Nobody seemed to know about that one.

Regardless, thank you for the support and time playing my characters.
================================================================================
SPECIAL THANKS:
================================================================================
To the people who brought me joy and were the light of my time here.

- Juno (formerly Sparx21): You were the first Rivals player I'd say I was
friends with. You were welcoming, fun to play with, and showed me just how
great the community could be.

- Tritone: Without you, ExW wouldn't have been formed. It was wonderful to
hangout with you and commentate my first ever bracket with you.

- Menace13: Would not have finished Kris originally without your help and
coding prowess within an engine I was unfamiliar with.

- ChaokoCartoons: Your warmth and light brought something fantastic to the time
we spent together. When I was across the country at Genesis, you were that
person I knew I could rely on for making me feel comfortable.

- Archytas: It was nice to hangout with you at Riptide and Genesis. You were
the chill person I knew I could go to if I just wanted to be somewhere with
cooler energy.

- Sakamoto: One of the few people who actively made an effort to hangout with me
and I can't thank you enough for that. It made me feel far more welcome and
cared for than I felt I was at that time.

- Supersonic: The coding wiz himself. You're a great person, someone who is just
fun to be around, and your skills aided me more than you know. Workshop wouldn't
be the same without you.

- GigaDragon: Another base cast player that just had good vibes. I'm glad we're
friends. I wouldn't have traded a second of my time playing through pokemon
with you for anything.

- Akashi: If I were to point to anyone I'd think of as my figurative father, it
would be you. The comfort and layed back attitude you have was always something
I appreciated and I think many others around you do as well. With love <3

- Nemmy: My chaotic homegirl. It was nice to hang around you, to get to be
apart of that group to help support Hitfall as best I could, and to aid in
your dirt rat brainrot. I could always rely on you for being that voice to push
me towards greater things.

- Awootiful: Hatsune Miku herself. Your energy was welcoming, you were fun to
be around, charming as can be, and the one person I knew who could pilot that
old pubby. Thank you for believing in her.

- Ruby: One of the geniuses in Rose Petals! To think that our bond would've
started in a collab for a character I cared little for and spiraled into someone
I knew I could come to for creative ideas. Thanks for introducing me to my
favorite TTRPG of all-time.

- Hinata: One of the other geniuses in Rose Petals! Your creativity and
ingenuity with code really let us do some wild things. You had such unique ideas
and I'm glad to have worked with someone as crafty as you.

- Buttercup: Another genius in Rose Petals! Your help was always something we
appreciated. Glad to see you're still doing great things out there my fellow
Aigis enjoyer.

- Tailwindz: Man, where to start? The music guy for Rose Petals for quite some
time, landing big gigs at Riptide through sheer aura alone? Your confidence is
something that I envy and I look forward to seeing (and hearing) what you do
next.

- Toma_: Big dog with the trademark cap. I feel like the friend group I have
now is partly thanks to you. Your jovial nature, your charisma, even your love
for poking buttons, all generates an environment of fun for me. Thanks for
creating (one of) my safe spaces.

- JoeCool: Love you, big dog. From our time just playing games, to meeting in
person, we never did seem to get a drink together... did we? I'm glad I had
time to get to know you, to watch Steven Universe together, to keep having a
good ass time with you. You really bring a lot of love and energy into every
room you come in. I hope you know how treasured you are.

- Scribe: One of the swords of the Four Swords Adventure! Your technical insight
and lexicon of information never fails to impress me. Your encouragement of
wacky ideas really helped make me continue pushing for fun in my designs. Glad
to have met you.

- Eck$: I've got a lot to thank you for. You're easily one of the best TOs I've
worked with in Workshop. Your laxed nature really aided in making workshop fun
again, for me at least, and I think you forget just how much of an impact you
made on the scene overall. Not to mention, you're the most dripped out workshop
player I've ever met. Thank you.

- Zetta: From workshop icon to iconic girlboss, I've seen you grow and develop
your style, and I cannot thank you enough for everything you did for the
community. I hope, whatever you're doing out there, your as beloved and
cherished as you should be.

- McDucky: My drinking buddy irl. I just love being around you. You have such
a fun energy that I cannot be more impressed by. Every moment is something new
for me and yet it's always as fun as the last. One day we'll get another drink
and hopefully at a proper bar.

- DeltaParallax: Smooth grooves guy. Your talent is never not appreciated within
and outside of Workshop. You just have such a prowess with something I could
only wish I understood. Can't wait for more people to hear just how skilled you
are as a musician.

- Soka: I never had much of a chance to speak with you but you motivated me
greatly with this project. If I had any person to point to for making me want
to finish Kris' resprite, it was you.

There's many other people I want to thank. So much so that I could probably
fill this entire random file with. If you had a positive impact on my life, you
know who you are, know that I treasure you too.

But I'll leave it at that. For those who really really didn't like me, spiting
you was the greatest motivator I could ever have. I hope that you find peace and
a hobby that allows you to lift others up rather than tear those down.

Thank you Dan and the Rivals of Aether team for allowing me to be creative,
to allow myself to grow as an artist and creator, and for giving me the chance
to meet so many awesome people.

Thank you for playing.

================================================================================
What's Next?
================================================================================

For me, I want to focus my efforts on things that are mine and mine alone.
Workshop was great for me but I want to be more than just a modder for a
platform fighter. Maybe I'll return for Rivals of Aether 2 workshop, but I'm
not exactly sure if that will even be for me!

I'd like to work on projects that are an extension of me and who I am.
To tell stories only I can tell and connect with those who feel the same. For
people who've felt alone, who've felt unrequited love, who've felt like they
aren't welcome and don't belong, who've felt that the universe refuses to give
you that lucky break that everyone around you gets.

I want to connect with others.
To express that through my art.
To be more than just "the Kris developer".

We'll see where the road takes me.
I'm sure it'll be somewhere with ups and downs and I wouldn't have it any
other way. Life is a ride.

Thank you all for everything.
Love,
Equi
