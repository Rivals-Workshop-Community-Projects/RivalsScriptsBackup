description="Trummel & Alto are back, reimagined from the ground up! Woag. Use USpecial or FSpecial to land in a cloud and gain a Lightning Charge, then use empowered Aerial Lightning Strongs and a Lightning Bolt DSpecial to destroy your opponents! Alternatively, save your clouds to power-up your NSpecial. This version of Trummel has all-new codecs! Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods - including Sandbert with a Phone, which is your ticket to writing codecs for your OWN characters."
