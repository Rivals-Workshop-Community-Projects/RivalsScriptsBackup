Gimmick: Egg Hatch ----------------------------------------------------------
Like eggs from Pokemon, Egg's mechanic is to hatch. If Egg moves around enough, 
	it gains access to an attack called 'Egg Hatch'. Once it's meter is full, 
	you'll hear a jingle. Press Attack + Special or Attack + Taunt to activate it.
Egg Hatch is a very powerful move that covers most of the stage, similar to 
	Hero's Magic Burst. The Pokemon that Egg hatches into while performing this attack is randomized.
Certain attacks Egg has can easily increase it's movement meter, like Dattack, Fspecial, 
	and Dspecial. Although, if Egg dies, it has restart the process.

NSpecial: Adrenaline Orb ----------------------------------------------------------
In Pokemon, the Adrenaline Orb can be used to increase the chance that a wild encounter 
	calls for help, creating an SOS battle. SOS chains are a popular way of finding shinies 
	in the Generation 7 games.
In Rivals, it works a little bit differently. Egg can place the Adrenaline orb down as an 
	article. This article can be interacted with by Egg's specials.

FSpecial: Egg Drop ----------------------------------------------------------
Egg Drop is a lunging command grab. If the first hitbox connects, 
	Egg will slam the opponent into the ground.
The mechanics of Fspecial work similarly to Bowser's Fspecial, in that the second 
	hitbox of the move is only created if Egg lands with an opponent.
Egg is forced to drop the opponent if they don't land within 1 1/2 seconds.
Fspecial can be cancelled mid air if Special is pressed again. 
	Egg will squeeze the opponent which has set knockback.

USpecial: Wonder Trade ----------------------------------------------------------
Uspecial is a VERY funny move. Like Wondertrades in Pokemon, if this attack hits, 
	it will switch the positions of Egg and it's opponent.
Uspecial spawns a trade symbol which can be controlled by using directional inputs. 
	Pressing Special again after the symbol is created will teleport Egg to it. 
	If the symbol is activated on an enemy, they will be sent to where Egg was.
Uspecial can be cancelled by pressing Shield.

DSpecial: Shiny Charm ----------------------------------------------------------
Dspecial is a counter. Unlike most Rivals counters, Shiny Charm is coded so that when it's 
	activated, Egg turns to face the way it's hit. Dspecial's counter power also scales 
	to the attack it was triggered by.
Hitting Dspecial will activate Egg's Shiny Charm, which increases it's hatch rate times 2 for 10 seconds.
In Practice Mode, the counter activation boxes will be visible.

NSpecial: Interactions with Specials ----------------------------------------------------------
Nspecial: The Adrenaline Orb, can be used in multiple ways with Egg's specials.
With Fspecial, Egg can grab the Orb like an opponent, and slam it down. If this hits and 
	opponent, it will increase Egg's hatch rate by 200.
If Egg already has grabbed an opponent with Fspecial or Ustrong, it can bounce off of the 
	Adrenaline orb, which creates a Basketball hoop in front of it. Egg can use the 
	hoop to slam dunk the opponent it has. Hitting this attack increases the hatch rate 
	by 400, and activate Dspecial's Shiny Charm boost.
If hit by Uspecial, the Adrenaline Orb will switch places with Egg and create an explosion. 
	If this hits an opponent, it will increase Egg's hatch rate by 200.
Uspecial can also initially grab the orb during it's startup, causing it to move with 
	Uspecial's Mark. If you hit the opponent, it will detonate after switching places and 
	increase Egg's hatch rate by 200."
Adrenaline Orb can also be grabbed with Dspecial. Egg throws the orb as a projectile 
	if this happens. If this hits and opponent, it will increase Egg's hatch rate by 200.
	Keep in mind that the amount of hatch increase hitting these attacks gives doubles if 
	Egg's shiny charm is active.
