info3="Holding DAIR will allow you to hover, and holding NAIR on the ground during its active frames gives her a speed boost."
info2="NSPECIAL can be aimed, but you'll have to pick it back up if it hits something! Try hitting the daruma with the move."
info1="FSPECIAL brings her sunglasses-wearing daruma onto the stage. If someone is hit by or hit in range of it, it'll lock on for a followup!"
