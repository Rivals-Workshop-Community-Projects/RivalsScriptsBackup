[h1]- to Enjoy the Rain -[/h1]

Usher loves rain, snow, umbrellas and chocolates.

awaken.

Usher Evalate, a girl who lives in an entire world of desperate utopia, seemingly, wishingly, free of conflicts. Her life is nothing more than a slice-of-life, not an adventure.
Not much things happened in her life to fill a profile for her, but that means she has lots more to experience in the world.
But experience is hardly gained from lack of trouble. And besides, life is not free of trouble, is it? Time and time again, her life twists and turns to see more trouble.
And this string of fate crossing, between worlds... is not one of these twists. it is strictly not canon

"my character was... greatly overhyped"
Her moveset and gimmick is a simple one. You don't have to play too long to figure out what she can do!

[h2]:: Moveset ::[/h2]

Let me explain Down Special first. It'll make things easier.
[b]:: Down Special (Rainfall Roll)[/b]
[b]This move is a grab.[/b] A command-grab as they call it. Keep in mind grabs like these can be done in the air too!
When you successfully grab an opponent, Usher rolls the opponent on her umbrella and tosses them upward. [b]When the opponent is thrown,[/b] they will be applied with a unique status - [b]a raincloud surrounds them![/b]
This raincloud will constantly [b]rain down to the ground,[/b] which gets thinner and thinner until it fades out. [b]This rain can be [u]frozen[/u] by some other moves,[/b] which also freezes the raincloud and the opponent inside!
Don't panic though, because the [b]freezing is a hitbox.[/b] If you're calm enough, [b]you can parry it, roll it, or airdodge it[/b]... But remember, [i]those actions can leave you open sometimes, too![/i]
Another thing: when you throw, [b]you can hold backward to turn around.[/b]

[b]:: Neutral Special (Iceball)[/b]
...You know the iconic plumbers right? Yeah, those ones. This Neutral Special? It's literally their Neutral Special also.
But this time, it's an ice ball ... and [b]it can [u]freeze[/u] the rain from the raincloud,[/b] from earlier!
Usher creates a forward-moving projectile that follows gravity, and bounces back up upon touching the ground.
I even tried my best to get the physics right, too. The height against the platform and the bounce height and all that.
And yes, you can "wavebounce"!

[b]:: Side Special (Weather Step)[/b]
Usher opens her umbrella and thrusts it forward with forward momentum. A quick movement-y move that is quick to come out, quick to move, and has a hitbox to maybe follow up a combo just a little bit!
In addition, [b]by pressing SPECIAL again,[/b] the umbrella reverses and lets out a freezing burst. Not enough range to hit an opponent? This might just hit them!
[b]This, too, can [u]freeze[/u] the rain from raincloud[/b] applied with Down Special!
Oh, and something extra is that this move? [b]Can be cancelled out of by landing.[/b] What's more extra is that you can land normally by holding Special as you land!

[b]:: Up Special (Thru-cloud)[/b]
It looks like there's starting to be a pattern but nope, this move doesn't freeze stuff.
[b]Up Special sends you upward[/b] with a hitbox on you! There's an early extra hitbox right before you launch up, too.
The early hitbox sends opponents downward if you are in the air when you start the move!
In addition, [b]by holding or pressing SPECIAL at the peak of the ascent[/b], Usher will open the umbrella, [b]slowing down descent![/b] Lets you float down and drift horizontally too.

[b]:: Other details[/b]
- [u]The more you freeze the raincloud rain, the more its lifetime timer decreases.[/u] You can't just send people offstage and Iceball them forever.
- I didn't write it in the specials section because it was getting mouthful already, but [b]Forward Strong is a freezing move too.[/b] Not only that, a strong one - [b]Freezing the rain with this hits the opponent much harder![/b]
- Neutral Air is a long-lasting kick, seen often in Neutral Airs. Usher's work slightly different in that it's [b]stronger the later you hit it.[/b] [u]But that's not all[/u] - [b]You can press ATTACK again to do an extra downward kick[/b] to launch people down!
- Forward Tilt is a forward umbrella swing. Sounds simple enough, and it is - but have you ever heard of [b]Pivot Cancel[/b]? It's where you dash, and quickly turning around for a split second before doing Forward Tilt in the direction you were dashing originally. If successful, you do Forward Tilt instead of Dash Attack. This grants you [b]extra forward momentum and range![/b]
