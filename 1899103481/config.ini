description="Targma's unconventional fighting style revolves around his Neutral Special, a half-solidified down lava ball that can bounce off his opponent and be knocked around, and setups/traps to make the stage his own territory. Some of his moves have certain properties that give him extra options. Hold Neutral Special while shooting a ball to gain recoil momentum, or hold it after a ball is in play to pull Targma and the ball towards each other! Special thanks: Giik (coding help/example), Menace13 (coding help), NyxTheShield (coding example), Kerus (background lore), Muno (coding), Supersonic and more people I forgot to mention"
