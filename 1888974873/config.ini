FEATURES:
-timed button presses that give specials a boost (EX: inputting it again when the timer hits 0 for Launch Party) (messing up the inputs can lead to the attack auto-cancelling!)
-cool rainbow alt that changes colors
-references to a lot of Rhythm Heaven games
-all new sprites by me made over a month and a half
-a full moveset
-working CPU AI
-kirby compatibility
-visual cues to help with the timing mechanic in practice mode
-super secret taunt that references everyone's favorite rhythm game

TO-DO:
-change walk/run hurtboxes
-make the numbers on up special not reversed in the air (the code i currently have only works when grounded for some reason)
-make jab unparryable
-fix a bug where the timing helper doesn't show up in practice mode when the last VS match had no timer


Please do not edit/reupload this mod or use my sprites without my permission! I have put a lot of time and effort into it!
I hope everyone enjoys using this mod!"
