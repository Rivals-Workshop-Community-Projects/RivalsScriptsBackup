description="Happy Cinco De Mayo to the Rivals of Aether workshop! As a gift, have this Piñata made entirely for and filled with fun! I bet you weren't expecting this, after all, her element is the element of SURPRISE! How do you play her? That's also a surprise, but I'll explain at least a few things for you. Dspecial can be canceled out of by dodging or attacking (with the exception of specials) once you hit with it, keep this in mind! Dash attack can cancel into down strong or ftilt at any point, you'll want to decide on which one to use based on where the opponent is trying to escape and where they currently are. Both moves have less startup when canceled into this way. You can see what present you'll drop when doing Dair for a few frames before it drops, try checking it by short hop fast falling, the present you see will be what drops next time! Your Nspecial is on a cooldown, check the little party ball on your hud to see when it will be ready next! Speaking of, the items that drop from the party ball can be grabbed by you or the opponent with by attacking them. You can then throw them using an normal. WARNING: do NOT under any circumstances hit Ani's partyball while it's starting up! Ani can't harm it, but the opponent can! The candy ani drops when getting hit can be eaten by opponents to restore 1hp, but it will briefly stun them and cancel their attack. If their attack is disjointed or a projectile, they may destroy the candy without eating it! Ani was intended to be an anniversary gift for workshop, but got delayed due to the standies. I hope you enjoy Ani as if it was your birthday every day! Happy Birthday Workshop!!"
