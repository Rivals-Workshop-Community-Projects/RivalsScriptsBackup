/*
 * AG_MUNO_ATTACK_CD_SPECIAL values:
 * - 1: the cooldown will use the phone_arrow_cooldown variable instead of move_cooldown[attack], causing it to display on the overhead player indicator; multiple attacks can share this cooldown.
 * - 2: the cooldown will use the phone_invis_cooldown variable instead of move_cooldown[attack], which doesn't display anywhere (unless you code your own HUD element) but does allow you to share the cooldown between moves.
 * 
 * AG_MUNO_WINDOW_CD_SPECIAL values:
 * - 1: a window will be exempted from causing cooldown. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to do this for any startup windows, so that the cooldown doesn't apply if you're hit out of the move before being able to use it.
 * - 2: a window will reset the cooldown to 0.
 * - 3: a window will set cooldown only if the has_hit	      variable is false, and set it to 0 if has_hit        is true.
 * - 4: a window will set cooldown only if the has_hit_player variable is false, and set it to 0 if has_hit_player is true.
