info3="If you're in USpecial and touch a Rune, you get your double jump back and won't go into pratfall."
info2="FSpecial costs one charge. If it's near a rune, it will snap to it and grow in size and damage. Hold Special to increase its range."
info1="DSpecial can create up to two runes. NSpecial will go to the next rune, then to your opponent, if it hits a rune."
