info1="Much like Pomme, Bowser Jr can hover in midair! While some attacks will maintain the hover, others will cancel it."
info2="Bowser Jr's homing cannon targets nearby foes, but firing small cannonballs isn't its only function. Try using his other specials on it!"
info3="Up Special ejects Bowser Jr from his clown car, but he can get it back by landing or pressing attack, special, or jump after getting hit."
