description="Finally, everyone's favorite Pokemon is being added to Rivals of Aether! People like Litleo, right...? Anyway, this was made for the Pokejam, so I hope this character will be fun, unlike... that bird. Litleo is a rushdown fighter that uses air comboes to his advantage. Despite them being a bit slower and weaker on the ground, keep opponents back using a fire ball! To catch opponents off guard, you can explode them with Down Special!"
