description="Barr is a stickman that uses his own meter as a weapon. The more meter Barr gains, the more range his sweetspots will have!"
info1="Barr can increase his meter by hitting opponents with sourspot or non-meter attacks. If he hits a sweetspot, his meter will decrease."
info2="NSPECIAL creates a floating orb. Hitting the orb with a meter attack will create a hitbox of full sweetspot strength on the orb."
info3="DSPECIAL flips Barr's meter around, tipper hitboxes becoming hilt hitboxes. DSPECIAL will also cause any orbs to produce a hitbox."
