info1="ok so, the plate mechanic is still being worked on, as of now it gives tough guy until it breaks, it has 27 hp and it slowly replenishes over time"
info2="fspecial and dspecial are stuns used to approach the opponent and look at them, nspecial is a command grab that has a special window in which you can either make it stronger by pressing special or the opponent can parry you"
info3="if you look at an opponent for long enough the bar on the HUD will increase giving you damage and speed on walls for each stage, also yes you can walk on walls for a limited time and use tilts and strong on them, the angle for the attacks changes with the wall so anything can become a spike"
