description="Tempo is Coda's Echo Fighter - while Coda's Power Chords are similar to Shulk's Monado Arts, Tempo's are more experimental and zany. She can stun enemies, slide across the stage, and even reverse her attacks' knockback angle! All other traits are the exact same. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods."
