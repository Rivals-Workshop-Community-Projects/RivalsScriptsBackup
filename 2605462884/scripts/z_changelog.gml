explorer changelog

v1.4
- you can now hit the bottom of EXPLORER's NSPECIAL blocks to remove them. this should hopefully give you a chance to recover?
- EXPLORER can now hit their FSPECIAL on the NSPECIAL blocks to "recover" them. directly into your block meter!
- - -
- reduced lifetime of DTILT (by increasing gravity and the bounce count until it disables itself)
- - this applies to DATTACK projectiles as well because it uses the same hitbox
- increased FSPECIAL grab hitbox forward range by uh 8 pixels
- added knockback scaling to FSPECIAL throws by 0.3 (there were some complications but i figured things out) (0 -> 0.3)
- decreased JAB movement max speed by 0.5 (3.5 -> 3, not accounting for friction which makes the speed usually lower)
- JAB base knockback incrased by 1 (6 -> 7) (experimental) 
- JAB knockback growth increased by 0.1 (0.1 -> 0.2)
- JAB startup increased by 2 frames and endlag decreased by 2 frames (startup 4 -> 6, endlag 9 -> 7) (experimental)
- DSPECIAL boost Me Roll Moving hitbox size has been increased by uh 8 pixels in diameter (52 -> 60)
- DSPECIAL boost Me Roll Moving now increases your dash/walk speed by 0.5
- DSPECIAL boost Me Roll Moving's rotation is much faster (just a visual change)
- DSPECIAL boost Crumble Jump hitbox size has been decreased by uh 50 pixels in diameter (350 -> 300)
- DSPECIAL "casting" time has been decreased by 20 frames (60 -> 40)
- DSTRONG startup is shorter by 2 frames (15 -> 13) - to be exact, it's the pre-charge time that has been shortened (10 -> 8)
- USTRONG endlag has been increased by 5 frames (im too lazy to count there are too many windows)
- increased UTILT endlag by 2 frames i think? and added an additional whifflag? (sorry for being lazy to count these)
- UTILT 2nd hit hitbox size has been decreased by uh 10 pixels in diameter (w70 h84 -> w60 h74)

v1.3
- decreased shorthop distance (speed 8 -> 5.5)
- extended hitboxes for FAIR (1st hit), UAIR (weak low hit), BAIR (1st hit) downwards
- FAIR 2nd hit knockback scaling increased (0.4 -> 0.5)
- BAIR 1st hit knockback scaling increased (0.5 -> 0.6)
- BAIR 2nd hit knockback scaling increased (0.7 -> 0.8)

v1.2
- you regain uspecial when you get hit (or when you get into hitstun)

v1.2
this too is a quick patch (eaeae) somethign i noticed myself
- you regain uspecial upon walljump

v1.1
this is a quick patch so doesnt have a proper hyyuponia style changelog

- made it so that uspecial doesnt recover when youre on the block you made
- made it so that block expiry doesnt give you back the block
- explorer vs. explorer "custom hurt state" works now (i needed the URL)

v1.0
