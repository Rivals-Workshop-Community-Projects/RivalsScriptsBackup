Bugingi is a god of matter and is a member of a hivemind with the same name.
They wonder the realm of the gods and observe, Learning how to create many different kinds of contraptions.

Personality:
Bugingi is mostly nonsensical. pretty much constantly spewing non sequitur statements and occasionally breaking the fourth wall.
Despite this, Bugingi is mostly chilled out and doesnt really ever come off as agressive or anything.

The Hivemind:
The Bugingi Hivemind are a collection of small pink worms which come together and form larger humanoid creatures.
They use their matter abilities to create a green shell around their body to give themselves a more appealing look.
The more worms that come together the higher tier bugingi you will get. The one in rivals is a low tier Bugingi.

The Hierarchy goes as follows:
Bug - Lowest tier, is one of the projectiles that bugingi can throw out
Worker - Second lowest tier, have a lot of shell but are generally dumber and weaker than soldiers. This is seen as one of the Jackpot Projectiles.
Soldier - This is the form seen in rivals. Soldier bugingi are the most common and is the first tier to be able to display intelligence.
Commander - Much stronger and more intelligent than the previous tier, a lot less common.
Royal - Almost never seen, Royal bugingi generally stop creating weapons with matter and use the matter itself as a weapon.
Queen - The queen is formed once every single worm congregates into one place.

Story:

Before coming a god, The hivemind were an incredibly invasive species.
after eliminating life on their home planet, They would hitchike onto nearby space ships and invade their home planets.
Due to Being a hivemind and the only living species on that planet. That planet's god soul was placed into the hivemind.
Being a hivemind they all shared one soul, Which transported the entire species to the realm of the gods upon ascension.

Becoming a god did not stop them however. They would continue to try to invade and eliminate other species.
The catch being that they were fighting other gods now. They were completely powerless against the other gods.
if they ever wanted to stand a fighting chance they would have to all combine into the queen.
The only problem with that was how scattered the species was when transported to the realm of the gods.

So they tried to all converge into one spot. But along the way something happened to them.
They would observe many different gods along their journey. Being completely powerless ended up making them see other beings in a new light.
They would grow attatched to the gods. Becoming ever curious about them. Slowly the bugingi would come to interact with these gods.
forming friendships and learning about the universe. Eventually the time came where the Bugingi reached their conversion point.
They have changed. The conversion was no longer for its original purpose to become all powerful.
They spend a brief time as the queen taking one last moment in this form. At which they demerge and journey out again.
Forever to wonder the realm.
