Probably just throw this into muno phone when that gets added

Background:
Bugingi is a god of matter and is a member of a species with the same name.
His role within TOTH doesn't really have much significance. due to the sheer abundance
of Bugingi due to being a hivemind they're seemingly everywhere within the world of TOTH.

Personality:
Bugingi is mostly nonsensical. pretty much constantly spewing non sequitur statements and occasionally breaking the fourth wall.
Despite this, Bugingi is mostly chilled out and doesnt really ever come off as agressive or anything.


Bugingi Race:
The bugingi race is a hivemind of intestine looking tubes which are able to harden and form into more humanoid shapes.
They also have the ability to split up and come together to form different tiers of bugingi.
If they all came together and formed into one creature they would become queen bugingi.
Their intelligence also increases the higher up in tiers you go.
The gender of the bugingi are completely dictated by what chromosones the majority of their intestines have.
this also means if they were to split or combine they could switch gender.

Combat:
Bugingi pretty much never attacks with pure matter, instead creating ordinary objects inside his body with it and spitting it out one way or another
