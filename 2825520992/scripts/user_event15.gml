║ Tips																		║
║																			║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Add Tips to your character, giving info on how to play or trivia. You can add
both text and images. It's recommended to keep these short-and-sweet, as in the
examples.

Use the initTip() function to start a new Tip:

	initTip(name);

Then, use the following functions to add content or paragraphs:

	initWords(text)
	
	initWords_ext(text, alignment, color, indent, ignore_height)
	
	initImage(sprite, frame)
	
	initImage_ext(sprite, frame, alignment, xscale, yscale, uses_shader, color,
		alpha, ignore_height, crop_left, crop_right, crop_up, crop_down)

Glossary:
	
	"_ext" at the end of a function name means an extended version of the
		function it's named after - giving you more formatting options.
	
	"alignment" can be the GML constants fa_left, fa_center, or fa_right.
	
	"color" can be any GML color, e.g. c_red, #00ff00, or make_color_hsv(...).
		Set this to a string (e.g. "h"), and it will be colored to the main
		color of whichever phone app the text is being displayed in.
	
	"indent" basically allows you to put any amount of "tabs" to the left of a
		paragraph.
	
	"sprite" can be any sprite index, e.g. sprite_get(...) or asset_get(...).
	
	"ignore_height" prevents this element from pushing the one below it
		downward. Set this to true to achieve effects such as two elements
		being side-by-side.
	
	"frame" can be 0 or any positive number for a static image, or a negative
		number for an animated image. The size of the negative number determines
		the framerate; -1 is the fastest, -2 is half as fast, -3 a third, etc.
	
	"uses_shader" determines whether or not the image should recolor with the
		character's alt costumes.
	
	"crop_left", "crop_right", etc allow you to crop an image by determining how
		far from the image's offset it should be drawn. Set all four to "noone"
		and it will use the entire image (including empty space).

NOTE: It's recommended to separate each paragraph into its own initWords() line,
so that things like page breaks can work properly.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Keep a record of your character's update history, and at the end, also give
credits to the developer(s) of the character or any assets used.

Use the initPatch() function to start a new Patch:

	initPatch(version_number, date)

If the "date" field is set to an empty string, then the Patch will act more like
a Tip - mainly useful for making an "About [character]" page.

Use the same functions as in the Tips app to populate the Patch with text and
images.

Here are two more content functions, which are designed for use in Patches but
also work in Tips:

	initHeader(text)
	initSection(text)

These are basically shortcuts for two different types of formatted text.
initHeader() is a text heading that is colored either blue or green, depending
on whether it's a Tip or a Patch. initSection() is an indented block of text.

These are handy for dividing a Tip/Patch into sections, such as different moves
in a Patch.

║ Cheats																	║
║																			║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Create options for players to change how the character plays, either as silly
fun bonuses or useful training utilities (e.g. filling a meter instantly).

Use the initCheat() function to create a Cheat:

	CHEAT_[NAME_HERE] = initCheat(name, [options], [option_names], description)

Glossary:
	
	"CHEAT_[NAME_HERE]" is a variable that stores the ID of the Cheat. In the
		example below, CHEAT_FLY is equal to 0. This is necessary for
		referencing your cheat later in your character's code.
	
	"[options]" is an array of the possible values that the Cheat can have. A
		simple example is [0, 1] for on and off, but it could also be something
		like [0, 1, 5, 9] or ["Cherry", "Strawberry", ""].
	
	"[option_names]" is an array of the displayed names for the options given in
		"[options]". It should be the same length as "[options]", and each entry
		should be a string.
	
To access a Cheat's current value inside your character's code, grab the entry
in the "phone_cheats" array at the index of the "CHEAT_" variable. For example:

	// update.gml
	
	if phone_cheats[CHEAT_FLY] == 1{
		vsp = -2;
	}

The "phone_cheats" array entry holds whatever value you defined in "[options]",
for the Cheat's current setting. (e.g. "phone_cheats" could contain a string,
not just a number)

You can also run code only at the moment that the Cheat was clicked on, by
using the "phone_cheats_updated" array (each entry is just true or false):
	
	// update.gml
	
	if phone_cheats_updated[CHEAT_FLY]{
		phone_cheats_updated[CHEAT_FLY] = 0; // you have to reset it yourself
		if phone_cheats[CHEAT_FLY]{
			print("Flight started");
		}
		else{
			print("Flight ended");
		}
	}

Pro tip: having a Cheat with only a single option is useful if you just need a
"click button to do X" thing for your character, e.g. "click to reset meter to
zero".
