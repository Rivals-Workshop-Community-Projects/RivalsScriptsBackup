info1="Cinder's USPECIAL, FSPECIAL, NSPECIALAIR-DTHROW, BAIR and DAIR use up her Fuel, which recharges on landing."
info2="DSPECIAL places down a fuel tank which creates a field that refuels Cinder when her Fuel bar isn't full"
info3="The fuel tank can only take 3 hits or refuel 3 times before it breaks, but it can also be detonated by using DSPECIAL again."
