// funny cat lore

// "owen" (lowercase), the pink cat, is a character made by "Owen" (uppercase),
// a friend of mine.

// details about owen are vague, not much is known about who they are
// or where they came from. they are friendly, personable, and not too shy.

// the pink cat does not have a proper name. they are simply named owen 
// because that was the character Owen chose to represent themselves 
// as at the time.

// owen first appeared as 3d model in Garry's Mod. 
// "Meta Contruct" is a server they frequent.

// there are some visual details present in the 3d model that don't exist
// in RoA WS's interpretation of the pink cat. these were omitted due to either
// not existing when the RoA mod was made (bow, collar) or for sprite
// simplicity (stripes, whiskers, shorts line, mittens).

// there are a few characters based on the pink cat. think of them as you
// would a Sonic OC or a Mario OC. 
// They are referenced in alts #2-6, #18, and #19.
// Who they are made by varies, but I made #4 and #5, and Owen made #2.

// "r", or "swen", is a friend of Owen. a running joke of mine was to spawn a "Wire
// Text Screen" which included only the letter "r", wherever they were present. this
// also appears in various places in the RoA mod.
