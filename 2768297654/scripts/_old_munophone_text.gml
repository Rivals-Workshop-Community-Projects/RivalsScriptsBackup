NSpecial: Wall Staple ------------------------------
- Duster's Nspecial throws a Wall Staple. It's not that special as an attack. 
	Wall staples is just a projectile. It can be used in neutral or for combo extensions.
- If a Wall staple connects with an active Smoke Bomb (see Dspecial), 
	the bomb will pop up and it's lifetime will be reset.

FSpecial: Blinding Speed ------------------------------
- Duster attacks with blinding speed! This attack is a fast horizontally traveling attack that Duster 
	can use to start or extend combos. If Duster hits the first hitbox, he'll followup with a second.
- Fspecial can be useful for recovering, but be careful using it offstage. 
	If you whiff the attack, Duster is put into pratfall.

USpecial: Bird Cage ------------------------------
- Duster's Uspecial uses a cage full of birds. This attack has a semi-powerful upward 
	sending hitbox that is useful for killing off the top.
- After the first initial boost of vertical speed, Duster will be able to float around while being carried 
	by the birds, but is forced to let go after a little while. 
	You can press Special, Shield, or Down to drop Duster early.

DSpecial: Smoke Bomb ------------------------------
- Using Dspecial primes a Smoke Bomb. While Duster holds this bomb, all of his attacks except 
	for his specials are replaced with moves that throw the bomb forwards, upwards, or downwards. 
	Pressing Dspecial again while Duster holds a bomb discards the bomb similarly to Z-drops in the Smash Bros series.
- When the smoke bomb comes in contact with the ground or an enemy, it activates and starts spewing smoke. 
	Once it makes 5 hitboxes, it'll disappear.
- If Duster holds a smoke bomb for too long, it'll activate on Duster, trapping him for a little bit. 
	This can be used strategically to prevent dying from a strong attack, but the timing is tricky.

Gimmick: 16-Hit Combos ------------------------------
- Duster's gimmick comes from his source material. Mother 3 is an RPG which has a battle system based on the music 
	playing in the battle. If you can time button presses with the beat of the song, 
	you can hit an enemy up to 16 times.
- In Rivals, if Duster hits an opponent, it will start a combo chain. He has a 7 second period to hit 
	the opponent again to raise his combo, which is reset each time he does. 
	If he doesn't hit an enemy within these 6 seconds, his combo is reset. 
	This timer can be reset by activating a parry. Hit an enemy 16 times to unleash a very powerful attack!
- Every 16th hit is boosted damage-wise and knockback-wise. All attacks do 16 percent and the knockback buffs are listed below:
		Aerials and Specials are raised to 6 * 1.15
		Grounded normals are raised to 7 * 1.15
		Strongs are raised to 8 * 1.25");
- Once Duster hits a 16-hit combo, his meter will go on cooldown for 10 seconds. 
	The same applies if he is parried during his combo, but the cooldown is only 5 seconds. 
	The cooldown created by getting parried can be removed by Duster parrying an attack.
