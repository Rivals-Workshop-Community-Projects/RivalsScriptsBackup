[general]
major version="1"
minor version="8"
Clover has been developed by Figburn(Art) and Spasco(Programming), the trailer music is by MyNewSoundtrack.

This competitive version was allowed by them, so don't burn me at the stake. 

Changes:
- Fstrong is not broken. It doesn't spike.
- Uair has less kill power and is slower.
- Dtilt is no longer jump cancellable.
- Dair is slower and weaker. 
- Nair sends more outwards.
- Air speed has been reduced.
- Ustrong is smaller and weaker.
~ Fall speed has been greatly reduced.
~ Utilt is now a multihit.
~ Fair spike sends at a worse angle and the move no longer affects momentum. However, the sourspot kills earlier.
+ Bair sends upwards for combos.
+ Ftilt now has consistent kb and angle and is faster in order to set up into DACUS and function as a get off me move.
+ Jab is now consistent with itself. 
+ Dattack now has a clean and late hit, with the late hit starting combos on di in.
+ Nspec is faster.
and probably other stuff that I forgot.

Special Thanks
- The rest of the Undertale Yellow team
- AWildDaydreamer for making Clover's splash art for the trailer
- Dan Fornace and the Rivals of Aether team 
- Toby Fox and the Undertale Yellow fans"
