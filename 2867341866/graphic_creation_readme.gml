/*
if you're making a graphic for aur:

i recommend booting up aurs colors.gml in cl-9a.github.io/RoAColorsGmlHelper/ (located in scripts folder, just open the file and copy paste all the data).
add his portrait (not fixed) css_draw, or one of his preview sprites (located in this folder), then  pick the alt, copy the image, etc.
all of aurs secret alts (which will be named) will show up at the bottom of the list, past the alts normally accessible in game.
sorry if this is more work than just going in game and taking a picture, but i dont want his player alts to be accessible by others easily, so this is the option im going with.
the current list of secret alts, for reference (this will hopefully be updated when i add them):
-mallow
-trail mix
