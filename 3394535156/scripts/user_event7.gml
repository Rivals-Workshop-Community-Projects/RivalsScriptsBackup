----------------------------------------------------
 
//// HOW TO ACTIVATE ////
 
Activate the codec by holding down and tapping taunt as Pit against another character.
 
----------------------------------------------------
 
//// INIT.GML ////
 
Add the following to the bottom of your init.gml file:
 
user_event(7);
 
(can change user event number to a different number as long as you change this file name number as well)
 
----------------------------------------------------
 
//// THIS FILE ////
Copy the entirety of this file into user_event7.gml and put it in your character's scripts folder.
 
Use the following function to add a new page to the codec:
 
initCodecPage(speaker, expression, sfx, text);
 
- speaker: one of the SPK_ vars.
- expression: see above 'EXPRESSIONS' list for each speaker's expression sprite.
- sfx: see above 'SFX' list for each speaker's sfx sound, plays at the start of each page. Set to a negative value to prevent any sfx from playing for that page.
- text: type what you want the speaker to say.
 
**EXAMPLE CODEC**
 
initCodecPage(SPK_PIT,  3,  10, "Floor ice-cream gives you health!");
initCodecPage(SPK_PALU, 1,  1,  "Hmm, is there anything you WONT eat?");
initCodecPage(SPK_PIT,  0,  8,  "Being an angel requires eating a lot of food.");
initCodecPage(SPK_VIR,  1,  6,  "Yeah, but eating off the floor is just gross.");
