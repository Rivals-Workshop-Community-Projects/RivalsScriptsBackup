description="Otto is back, with retouched sprites, changed attacks, and an entirely new gimmick! Throw a ball with NSpecial, then teleport to it by using any Bike Special. You can press NSpecial repeatedly to bounce or hover the ball, hit the ball with normals to launch it, or hold up/down during the initial throw to give the ball a Spin for different knockback. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods."
