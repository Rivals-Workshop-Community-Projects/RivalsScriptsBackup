description="Whispy Woods lives deep in the forest, waiting patiently for Kirby to stop by so he can share his delicious apples with the pink hero... That's not true at all, actually. Instead, he drops apples on Kirby, trying to cause him injury. He may look friendly, but remember what they say: Don't judge a tree by its bark."
