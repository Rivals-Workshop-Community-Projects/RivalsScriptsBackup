description="Whispy Woods lives deep in the forest, waiting patiently for Kirby to stop by so he can share his delicious apples with the pink hero... That's not true at all, actually. Instead, he drops apples on Kirby, trying to cause him injury. He may look friendly, but remember what they say: Don't judge a tree by its bark."

info1="Whispy's Nspecial shoots out a slow puff of air. Charging it for a bit changes it to a powerful mid ranged burst of air."
info2="Whispy's Fspecial causes a root to travel forward until it hits a wall or you press Special again. Press Parry to stall it in place."
info3="Whispy's Dspecial shakes apples out of his canopy, which can be hit around with your attacks or blasted forward with a Nspecial burst."
