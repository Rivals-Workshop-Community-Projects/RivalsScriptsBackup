Synne is a strange, extremely floaty zoner. Utilize their orbiting planets for powerful ranged attacks, and deploy an artificial sun to act as the centerpoint for any planetary attacks. Combined with a black hole that pulls in planet and fighter alike, they float weightless and fall as a meteor, their lethal dance both inspiring and unnerving."

description="On a night full of falling stars, they arrived. A light in the starry sky floats, chasing the moon, watching. Strange messengers made of light and alloy patrol the surface, wordless...yet observant. Watching. To any aggression, they retaliate tenfold."
