-   weighted behaviour array? 
        .neutral, advantage, disadvantage states
        .aggressive, passive, careful, agitated behaviours?
            .give cpu random 'personality' at the start of match that changes main behaviour weights?
-   'adaptive' learning (uses what works more often, but still throws out other moves at random)
-   state machine
-   'reaction' timer with slight variation depending on cpu level, that changes upon action or enough time has passed
        .different reaction times for movement, attacks, parries?
-   basic recovery & recovery mixup (wavedash onto stage)
