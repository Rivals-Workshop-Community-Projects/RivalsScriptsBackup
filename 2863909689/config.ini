info1="Hamood can place down an alarm clock with DSPECIAL. Hitting someone else in range of it, it does an automatic follow up."
info2="If Hamood lands USTRONG, FSPECIAL, or USPECIAL in the field, it'll startle him and turn the move into a quick combo attack!"
info3="He can also hit the alarm clock with NSPECIAL. Don't get hit inside DSPECIAL's range, or Hamood will be hit by the follow up instead!"
