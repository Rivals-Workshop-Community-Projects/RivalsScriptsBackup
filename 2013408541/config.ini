description="HARK, RIVALS! Slashe, Knight of the Rolling Wind, is now available for the Rivals of Aether Workshop! Slashe is a heavy sword fighter variant character with some shared moves from one of my previous characters, Ash. Her attacks have close range sweetspots similar to Roy from Super Smash Bros, but has more than enough range to keep foes off of herself. Land special attacks or Taunt to keep your highwind meter up, which boosts your ground and air movement speed, walljump height, and bumps your knockback defense from 1.1 to 1.2. You may also spend it all on one powerful attack by using Neutral Special, which can be charged and unleash a devistating attack if your Highwind is high enough. Fspecial will throw your sword forward (or diagonally above you if you hold up), and if it hits you warp to your now stunned opponent and can cancel into a variety of attacks! Down special is a safe way to charge highwind while readying up an attack, as it grants you super armor while you charge. A fully charged Dspecial is one of Slashe's most hard hitting attacks, and will send your opponent flying upward or spike them if they hit the tip of the sword, but be careful not to do it offstage, as you'll plunge rapidly into the blast zone! Upsecial can be used on the ground or in the air. Your horizontal mobility with uspecial is increased while highwind is active, making it great for offstage recovery! If Slashe is hit while yowling during her taunt, her helmet will fly off for the rest of the stock, and her taunt will start and end significantly faster! Most of her moves are significantly weaker if you hit the opponent with the sword, so if you're going for the kill, just pretend the sword isnt' there and rush straight into your opponents face! That said, Slashe's backair is the only move that has both a sweetspot on her hilt and on the tip of her swipe, it wont do a lot of damage, but a tipper from back air can kill at high percents, you just gotta maker sure you can time and space it right! With some completely new or heavily altered moves like down and side special, this character may not be exactly what you are used to with Ash, but you'll more than likely pick up on the new but familiar playstyle as you go!"
