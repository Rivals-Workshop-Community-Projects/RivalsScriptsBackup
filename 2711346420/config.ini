info1="The Monkey Ball increases your top speed when inside of it, but increases your hurtbox. It can also be used as a projectile!"
info2="USPECIAL and FSPECIAL are both good options for recovering and attacking. Performing the moves while the Monkey Ball is onstage worsens them, so watch out!"
info3="DSPECIAL is manually getting in or out of the Monkey Ball. Hold DSPECIAL while inside of it to place it down as a projectile."
