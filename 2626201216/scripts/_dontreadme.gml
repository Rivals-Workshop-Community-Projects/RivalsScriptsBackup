surprise! 

you were expecting an arg weren't you? I mean I don't blame you. the setup was perfect after all. but. nope. that's not what's here. this is. 

think of it as a note. a personal note. a personal note i'm sharing to the world. because i don't want this to rot in my journal forever.

this get uh, pretty dark and broody. don't read it if you don't wanna okay? 



here goes.


on the 15th of March. 2020. I, bought rivals. because i saw a linklight video with ronald. very funny haha meme man.
I took a good look at it. and. I told myself that, there was a chance. no matter how slim. that with 0 skill. 0 experience, 0 knowledge. that i would make a good character.
that. i could make something. worth playing. worth enjoying. that, maybe, even, I would get into a tournament. Can you imagine how amazing that would be? 
seeing someone, take your lovechild and push them. to the absolute limits. to see them. broken apart into their most constituent pieces, torn beyond the point of recognition.
at the highest point of recognition.

that was, 576 days ago. that number doesn't sound real. five hundred. seventy six. more than a year.else

and, i missed that slim chance. I have nothing.




none of my characters have even come close to being in a tournament

once i removed myself from any big name IPs, my only OC wallowed in complete obscurity

ffs they didn't even put me in the rivals workshop tier list



i. have nothing. bermaharajalela will be my last character. I don't, want, it to be my last character but.else
here's the thing.

I, love, doing this. i love everything about this. I love animation. I love art. I, wish I could just, do nothing but this. Forever. but. that's not how life works, is it?
If I want to keep myself afloat, it's quite obvious that I have to do other things. I, have a decent shot at hitting it well in academics
I could probably leave here and go get an engineering degree or something. And. In all likelyhood, I will.

Because, as much as I would love, to somehow land myself a spot in the animation industry or something. I gotta be real. That is a complete pipedream. 
People with way more time. With way more work. With way more talent*. Try. They try every day. And fail. So i would be an idiot. To assume that I'd be different. That I'd be a [[BIG SHOT]].
That I'd somehow make this improbable dream work.

No. I won't. If I strike out on my own, try to really put all my chips in. Odds are I'll fuck up and have to come crawling back to my parents for help to get out of the financial hell I've put myself in.
So. That's why this is my last character. Because if you're half commiting. Sometimes the other half falls apart. And sometimes you have to crawl back. And you have to stop it from falling apart.
I really screwed up this past year and now half of my commitments are falling apart and as much as this means to me.
I can't risk it. 

And. A part of me thinks that. This may not just be the breaking point for the short term, the next 6 months or so. This may be, THE breaking point.
I don't know how i'll feel in 6 months. I could dismiss this whole thing as some errant phase for all I know. 
If you're reading this past March 2022. You know the answer already. But the fog of the future tells me nothing. 





I feel like I got off onto a rant there. 

But, honestly. I have no idea what to even think about doing now. 
This whole time all I've wanted from Rivals was a confirmation. Something to tell me that. I could strike out. And maybe my odds werent' that bad. 
But all i've gotten is the opposite. I can't even make a decent character in a childrens' fighting game what hope do I have of trying to come out with a career? 
None. I have none. 

This is my last year in school. This, was my last year to prove to myself that I had an out. But i haven't. And so I don't. 
I don't have an out. I'll probably leave, get some shitty engineering degree, get some shitty engineering job, and forget all about this. 

... 



I, don't know what to write after that. I. Wanted this to be a slightly bittersweet lookback. Followed by a happy ending with hope. But. That's just not. what i have. 
I don't get the clean ending. I don't get shit. And I don't even get to end my farewell note the way I wanted. I'm sorry, this probably bummed you out a lot. 
Or maybe you think i'm an idiot. I have no idea who could possibly be reading this. It is public of course. But only in the least so. I might write a condensed version of this. 
Slap it in my neocities blog. 
Call it "death of a rivals of aether character dev"
Or something equally absurd. And cut out all the sad parts. Give it a poetic ending. 

I don't have a poetic ending though. Not in reality. What I have is a sad story of my one attempt to get out. And a failure. And so I don't get out. 

That's it I don't. Really know what else to write. Sorry for your time. 


*for all you "that guys" out there by talent i mean "coincidental interest in as a child leading to being able to perform a certain task more adequately", alright? and by "that guy"
i mean me.
