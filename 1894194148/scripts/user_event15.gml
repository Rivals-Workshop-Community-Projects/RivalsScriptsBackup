//hi -hyu
//p.s. i only now read the later part of that warning text
//honestly i'm REAAAAAAALLY REAAAAAAALLY REAAAAAAALLY not feeling the whole "template-author-personalized standardization"? i know it's your brand and all, but if you want to "standardize" it, you should make it generic as well. i tried to keep the trace of munophone as much as i can though and i didn't alter user_event14, but i still dunno

//also, for my changes, there are in-lore explanations. read the diary.

	 * Tips are hints or instructions on how to play the character. They range
	 * from one-sentence descriptions to pages-long tutorials. You can also
	 * embed images and formatted text.
	 * 
	 * initTip(name)
	 * initTipWords(text)
	 * initTipImage(sprite, frame, align, xscale, color, gimmick)
	 * initTipWords_ext(text, align, color, indent, gimmick)
	 * initTipImage_ext(sprite, frame, align, xscale, color, gimmick, border_l, border_r, border_u, border_d)
	 * 
	 * NOTE: indent = a number of "tabs", not a number of pixels
	 * 
	 * To place two consecutive elements side-by-side, they must meet the
	 * following conditions:
	 * - The second element must not be text
	 * - The width of the two elements must not exceed the page width
	 * - One element must be left-aligned, and the other right-aligned
	 * 
	 * NOTE: For images, set frame to a negative number and it will animate the
	 * sprite at that rate. E.g. set to -3, each anim frame will last 3 frames.
	 * 
	 * Another image-related note: the placement for images is calculated based
	 * on the BORDERS of the sprite. Two consequences:
	 * - The offset of the sprite (load.gml) has NO effect.
	 * - If your sprites are made with a lot of transparent empty space around
	 *   the actual content (like mine are), it'll have that much extra space
	 *   around it in the tip.
	 * 
	 * To fix the second bullet point, use initTipImage_ext(), with the four
	 * extra "border_" arguments representing the distance FROM THE SPRITE'S
	 * OFFSET (as defined in load.gml) to "cut off" the sprite in each of the
	 * four directions. E.g. if your sprite's actual content is all contained
	 * within these distances from the sprite offset:
	 * - 100 to the left
	 * - 20 to the right
	 * - 50 up
	 * - 0 down
	 * 
	 * ...then the last 4 arguments should be 100, 20, 50, 0. It basically crops
	 * the sprite
	 * 
	 * Lastly, the "gimmick" is a special effect that you can apply to an
	 * element. Here's the list of implemented gimmicks:
	 * - 0: Nothing
	 * - 1: Shaking
	 * - 2: Scrolling left
	 * - 3: Scrolling right
	 * - 4: Ignore vertical scroll (always placed at top of screen)
	 * 
	 * Negative gimmick numbers are saved for whatever YOU might need them for!
	 * Like idk, if you're a coding wizard and figure out something cool to do
	 * by interacting with the tip data.
	 *

	i'm so grateful ranno gave me a whole bunch of bread to eat. without them i'd probably be lost in these thoughts forever while i starve.

	i did try to convince him that my 'other' definition of acid could still be used non-lethally, but my destructive acidic power was my primary fighting style so i couldn't argue much. we deemed our element not quite compatible, although we still respect both each others' abilities.");
	initTipWords("i wished him the best and decided to wander off in this world looking for what new things i can see, maybe even find somewhere else to call home. i'll see.");
	initTipWords("the leads i have are four primary locations he told me - the capital city of fire, merchant town of water, tree-top village of earth beyond the rock wall, and the city of steam and air. i wonder which element i'll find most comfortable with?
	i feel like my element of 'acid' doesn't quite fit into any of the four primary elements he told me about. some say acid is flammable, liquid-like, earthly material. and i paint clouds? those are like vaguely all 4 elements! well. i guess if ranno's poison is 'water', it might not be that much of a stretch to call mine water element as well.")
