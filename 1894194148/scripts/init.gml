//
//surprised you're reading this.
//i thought this'd be just a drop in the rain.
//just a number, not a name.
//but here you are reading the code,
//perhaps you sense something special in this?
//
//i doubt that, but i guess it's up for others
//to judge these things.
//
//in the codes, you'll find my struggles as i
//try to code the more complicated parts of
//of this character.
//
//i've chosen the "lone wolf" way,
//not checking what was ever going on in the
//workshop nor discord as i've worked on this
//for two months.
//alas most of the code here was largely
//based on what i could find in guadua and
//the official modding manual.
//you can find a lot of leftovers from the
//"empty workshop character template" as well.
//
//most of these two months were taken by the
//3d reference/spriting step.
//i was not confident in my ability to sprite
//the animations head-first, so i first tried
//to animate a model in 3d first to get myself
//some reference frames.
//
//i was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is
//to implement simple, normal attacks.
//even a simple recovery move would have been
//easy as well.
//however some of the more slightly complicated
//parts of few moves have shown themselves to
//be quite difficult, especially for ones such
//as me who are not experienced in coding.
//but honestly? that's very fair.
//this is even officially considered *modding*,
//after all. it isn't supposed to be super easy.
//
//however, i've managed it.
//i don't know how my creation fares against
//the others in the workshop. but by finishing
//this i've finally set myself the line of
//"what i am capable of".
//now that i've finished this, i can finally
//browse everything in peace, without my
//inferiority complex kicking in.
//
//to you who are somehow, and for some reason
//reading this,
//
//thank you so much a-for-to playing my character!
//
//may heaven grant you fortune,
//hyuponia halfmirage

//100% respects for mister supersonic. below pasted code;

//this var makes f5 not break the buddy if developing with more than one
//workshop character or buddy in the match
