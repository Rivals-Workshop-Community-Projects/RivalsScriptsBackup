info1="Go-Lucky's Nspecial has him pull out his gun. Pressing the Strong button while the gun is out will shoot wherever the reticule is."
info2="You can enter/exit gun stance or shoot the gun during any action, though you can't have it out forever and eventually have to reload."
info3="Fspecial throws a cursed orb, increasing gun accuracy against foes hit with it. You can also mark Dspecial clones to detonate them."
