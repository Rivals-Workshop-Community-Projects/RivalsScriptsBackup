info1="With NSPECIAL, Tape can get off his dispenser to move more swiftly and gain access to a new moveset. He's also weaker and lighter."
info2="All of Tape's specials take him out of the dispenser, but using them while on it may yield different results."
info3="FSPECIAL comes slightly pre-charged when used out of the dispenser. DSPECIAL will make Tape jump regardless if he's airbone or not."
