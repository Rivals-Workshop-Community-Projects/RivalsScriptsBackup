info1="Jirachi, the Wish Pokemon! Jirachi is quite floaty, and is capable of doing 2 double jump per airtime."
info2="All of Jirachi's STRONGs can only be used in the air, just like Wrastor, if you're familiar with that example."
info3="DSPECIAL is Doom Desire, a move that promises your opponent a sure STAB damage 2 turns from now... Unless you want to hit people into it?"
