-- Beta V0.2 --

Gameplay Changes:
- Dtilt now has a different variant of the move if you do it near the ledge.
The move is a single hit which goes slightly below the player.
The blue version carries over the properties of the original 2nd hit.
and the red version carries over the properties of the original 1st hit.

- You can no longer jump cancel dattack after the final hit
- Jump cancelling dattack gives a short boost in speed
(the aim was to give dtilt -> dattack more purpose)

- Dattack should now (hopefully maybe) connect better


- Charged fspecial gives a short boost in speed upon hitting the kunai
