----   IDEAS   ------
- turnip-like projectile: ghost
-> can be thrown and re-caught again
-> has to be bad at long distance or camping
-> animation: ghost follows you when you have it
-> idea: throwing action gives momentum depending on throw angle (!) 
->... too much like targma??


- something else with a small ghost that gives you extra options and mind-games potential
