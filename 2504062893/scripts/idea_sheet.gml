--- POST RELEASE IDEAS ----
- Rework Nspecial to some actual attack with hitbox, make it synergize with other specials
- Actually synergize all specials with each other, such as throwing shuriken at ghost
- Deception element for Nspecial maybe?
- 


----  (old) IDEAS   ------
- turnip-like projectile: ghost
-> can be thrown and re-caught again
-> has to be bad at long distance or camping
-> animation: ghost follows you when you have it
-> idea: throwing action gives momentum depending on throw angle (!) 
->... too much like targma??


- something else with a small ghost that gives you extra options and mind-games potential
