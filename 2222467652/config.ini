description="Bird Luigi was my entry for the VS Bird Guy contest, and I hope you all enjoy playing it! Bird Luigi is a fast-paced combo character with the ability to kill extremely early with his green fire, which applies a damage over time that will go away if you don't constantly apply his fire-based moves. Dstrong, Ftilt, and occasionally even the egg will reset the timer of the damage over time if it won't last as long as the timer it will apply, but maintain the level of temporary fire damage that the opponent racks up, making Ftilt his best option to combo into killmoves because the few seconds of time that ftilt will preserve the fire can be crucial for killing with one of his more powerful attacks."
