description="Steve joins the world of Rivals! He's trying to speedrun and beat Minecraft, and he's fed up with getting bad seeds. Pull out one of 21 different items using NSpecial, and place blocks with USpecial to give yourself a speed boost! You can also land crits, place water, and light foes on fire. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods."
