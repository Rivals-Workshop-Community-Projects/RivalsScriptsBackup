info3="Water pushes more than players; try projectiles! Also, fire pairs quite well with arrows from Steve's bow."
info2="While standing on a block, you have a speed boost which carries over if you jump or run off of the block."
info1="NSpecial presents you with a different set of items each time, but there is a pattern to be discovered. Each item is one-time-use."

description="Steve joins the world of Rivals! He's trying to speedrun and beat Minecraft, and he's fed up with getting bad seeds. Pull out one of 21 different items using NSpecial, and place blocks with USpecial to give yourself a speed boost! You can also land crits, place water, and light foes on fire. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods."
