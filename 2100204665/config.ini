info1="Papyrus's Neutral Special, Blue Attack, turns opponents blue. This means they can't double jump unless hit, but can jump higher in turn."
info2="Papyrus's specials can be used to jape his foes in many ways, and have unique effects on blue turned opponents."
info3="Up Special can not only be used to use stronger attacks higher up, but also to place Down Special's bone trap on."
