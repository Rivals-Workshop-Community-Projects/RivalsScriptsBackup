A floaty, yet powerful character, Blake uses his unique tools and range to effectively get the job done. 
His main gimmick, while relitively small, provides alot of diffrent options with his Trashbag

Special thanks to Rainbow, Dreem, and Dino for coding!
As well as Snolid Ice and ricE for helping with misc stuff
And Hyuponia and Deltaparalax, for making the portrait and victory theme respectively"
