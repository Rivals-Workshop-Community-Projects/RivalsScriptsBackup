info1="Voltorb's Static gimmick works by parrying while charging Fspec. It powers up Specials and Strongs for instant use and bonus effects."
info2="The charge disappears on one use, so don't waste it. This doesn't apply to Uspec, though."
info3="He can also explode with Dspec: a massive, powerful move which also damages the user. It gets much stronger when used with Static."
finished="0"
