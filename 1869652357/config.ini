description="Get ready to run like the wind! Ash (Original Character belonging to Andy Ayala, character designer for Rivals of Aether) is ready to rumble! Spritework, animations, move design, and move programming done by myself. Credit to Andy Ayala for the design of Ash and her profile image, an upated version of an older illustration of Ash. Preview and Profile may be edited later to have fully original artwork more close to the other Rivals characters. Ash is a Rushdown/Cancel Combo type fighter, she can put the pressure on hard, but can be knocked away easier than others! I also made a variation of this character called 'Slashe' if you want a character with more range that hits harder and can take more hits, she even has some unique moves of her own! Slashe can be downloaded from here: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2013408541"
