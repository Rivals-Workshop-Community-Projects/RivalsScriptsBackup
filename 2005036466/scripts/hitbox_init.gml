//A fascinating story, I thank you for telling me.
//Hm? A story from me?
//Ohoho, of course you'd assume I have one.
//When you've travelled as long as I have, it's only natural you'd have one or two.
//Well, my friend, unfortunately my tale is not one worth hearing.
//My story's a story of failure. Not of any grand failure or fall from grace.
//No, simply... Mundane, normal stories of mistakes made.
//I do not wish to tell you my tale, but I will tell you what I learned from it.
//In hopes that you may understand what I say.
//Do not fear failure. Embrace it. Rush towards it. Fail as soon as you can.
//And do not be discouraged.
//Recognizing your failures is the first step to growth, after all.
//And that it's never too late to grow.
//...I'm sure you're wondering why I'm telling you this rather than a story.
//Well, you'll have to forgive me.
//Sometimes, you tell a story for your own sake, rather than the listener's.
//I thank you for your ear, my friend.
//I hope your adventures through this land goes better than mine.
//Hm? What's that?
//Why am I here?
//Ah, of course. Well, there's a simple answer.
//Rivals of Aether crashes if you have an empty GML file, after all.
