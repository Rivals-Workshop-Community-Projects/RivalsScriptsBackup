info1="Liz's gimmick is ''Rhythm meter.'' It increases gradually after one of your hitboxes connect."
info2="when the meter is full, it means your next attack is going to deal more damage if timed properly."
info3="The ''Octave mechanic'' makes your aerial attacks (and Nspecial) have extra knockback and damage."
