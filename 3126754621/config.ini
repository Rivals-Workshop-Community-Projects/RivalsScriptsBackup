description="Having defeated the King of Suave, Speedrunner Link is back to wreak havoc in Rivals of Aether!"
This version of Link is a reworked/updated version of my old Speedrunner Link mod from 2020, sporting cleaner animations and a fresh moveset utilising mechanics and items from Tears of the Kingdom.
info1="While charging FStrong or FTilt, certain items will be attracted to Link's trident/shield, fusing to the weapon if it touches Link."
info2="DSpecial activates Recall on the closest item to Link, rewinding their position for a period of time."
info3="Performing UStrong while standing underneath a platform will cause Link to ascend through the platform, regardless of platform height."
