/* STAT NOTES
 * The stats below are taken from Zetterburn, replacing Sandbert's overpowered
 * movement stats. The commented-out numbers are the range of values the RoA
 * base cast has - e.g. it lists the slowest and fastest run speeds.
 * 
 * Replace Zetter's stats with whatever strengths/weaknesses your char should
 * have, e.g. change dash_speed to 8 or so if you want a fast character.
 *
 * Explanation of each stat:

Cyan -         Mixture 20-4F         - A concoction that has strong heat-absorption capabilities and is an environmental toxin.
Red -     Compound 300D 10.5     - A concoction that has a distinct luminescent glow and has a high radiation level.
Orange -     Component 255165    - A concoction that has high heat production and is prone to detonation.

CCC - Liquid Nitrogen
    - Walt concocts a vial of pure cold.  Throwing it an an opponent causes them to get periodically frozen in place (0.5s freezes once every 3 seconds) and are stuck in hitpause for longer amounts of time if hit.
    Medium range projectile.
CCM - Weed Infusion
    - Walt concocts a chemical that he can ingest, making him floatier and jump higher.
    Self-cast.
CMM - Lily of the Valley
    - Walt concocts a highly potent poison that he can throw at opponents.  Opponents take damage over time when hit by it.
    Short range projectile.
CCO -  Superheated Water *
    - Walt concocts a vial of unstable water that can be thrown down into a puddle that, when touched by an opponent, violently explodes into steam.
    Stage trap.
COO - Grain Alcohol
    - Walt concocts a chemical that he can inject into himself for a small defensive buff and higher attack damage.
    Self-cast.
CMO - Hydrofluoric Acid *
    - Walt concocts a highly potent acid that he can splash in front of himself.  Opponents caught by the initial splash will take a high amount of damage.  The puddle left behind eats through stage platforms, so anyone attempting to use them will fall straight through.
    Stage trap.
MMM - Phosphene *
    - Walt concocts a chemical that, when thrown to the ground, puffs up in a gas of poison that floats upward, damage anyone touching the cloud.
    Stage trap.
MMO - Morphene
    - Walt concocts a chemical that strongly reduces all incoming damage and makes him heavier and harder to knock back.
    Self-cast.
MOO - Coffee 
    - Walt brews a cup of coffee that he can ingest, increasing his attack + movement speed and cuts Strong charging in half.
    Stage trap.
OOO - Fulminated Mercury *
    - Walt concocts a grenade that he can lob at opponents.  High firepower, high damage.
    High range projectile.
