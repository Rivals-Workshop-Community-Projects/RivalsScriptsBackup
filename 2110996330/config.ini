info1="Chef's FSPECIAL can be angled vertically, and edge-cancelled. Hitting SHIELD on hit will cancel the grab, allowing followup attacks."
info2="Use DSPECIAL to place GRILL, Chef's personal platform. It can be repositioned with any attack, including Chef's special attacks."
info3="NSPECIAL can be held until it ultimately explodes. In the meantime, Chef can fall through platforms and ride atop his GRILL."
