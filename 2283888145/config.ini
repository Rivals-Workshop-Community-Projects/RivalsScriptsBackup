description="Coda, the Air Guitarist, makes his Rivals debut! NSpecial allows you to access Power Chords, which are like Shulk's Monado Arts. You can also throw the Air Guitar with FSpecial or DSpecial, which takes away your ability to buff yourself - the charged FSpecial CHANGES if you have a Power Chord active! Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods - including Coda's Echo Fighter."
